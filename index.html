                <br>
                <h5>~Anti bribery and anti corruption policy</h5>
                <p>BuildWise Companion is committed to prevent and detect any fraud, bribery
                   or corrupt business practices. It is BC's policy to conduct business with 
                   honesty and the highest ethical standards and also enforce business activities
                   without engaging in corruption or bribery.
                <br>
                 <p>What is Bribe & Corruption?<br>
                    A bribe is any payment, inducement, advantage or reward offered, provided 
                    or promised to any individual in order to gain personal or commercial advantage.
                    It is said to be illegal to offer or receive a bribe directly or indirectly. A bribe may 
                    not be just money; it can be anything that has a value - gifts, entertainment,
                    sexual favors, offering employment, donation or contribution, etc.

                    Corruption is associated with bribery and results from patronage.
                    Corruption is considered to be a dishonest or criminal activity undertaken
                    by an individual or an organization invested with a position of authority.
